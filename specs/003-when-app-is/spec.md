# Feature Specification: Pre-Launch Minigame Mode

**Feature Branch**: `003-when-app-is`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "when app is not in launched mode yet (determined by an env variable), show the diamond-hands minigame instead"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: pre-launch minigame mode
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: launch mode state, environment variable control, diamond-hands minigame
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked clarifications needed for: minigame specifics, UI placement, data persistence
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow established: pre-launch entertainment experience
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements defined for mode detection, game display, and user interaction
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Game state, scores, launch mode configuration
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - minigame mechanics need clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a visitor to RaffleTime before the platform officially launches, I want to play an engaging minigame that introduces me to the platform's theme and keeps me interested until the main application becomes available, so that I remain engaged with the brand during the pre-launch period.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is in pre-launch mode (environment variable indicates not launched), **When** a user visits the application, **Then** they see the diamond-hands minigame interface instead of the main raffle platform
2. **Given** a user is playing the diamond-hands minigame, **When** they interact with game controls, **Then** the game responds appropriately and tracks their progress
3. **Given** the application launch mode is activated (environment variable changed), **When** a user visits the application, **Then** they see the main RaffleTime platform instead of the minigame

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the environment variable is misconfigured or missing?
- How does the system handle users who are mid-game when launch mode is activated?
- What happens if a user tries to access the minigame after launch (via direct URL or cached page)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST check launch mode status via environment variable on application initialization
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the diamond-hands minigame interface when in pre-launch mode (not launched)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the main RaffleTime platform when in launched mode
- **FR-004**: Minigame MUST be fully playable and implement the same code found in minigame-references/diamond-hands

### Key Entities

- **Launch Configuration**: Represents the application's launch state, controlled by environment variable, determines which interface to display
- **Game Session**: Represents an active minigame instance, tracks current game state and user interactions

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Outstanding Clarifications Needed**:
1. Specific mechanics and rules of the diamond-hands minigame
2. Whether game progress/scores should be persisted
3. If there should be launch notification signup functionality
4. Branding and messaging requirements for pre-launch state
5. Whether the minigame should be accessible post-launch as an easter egg
