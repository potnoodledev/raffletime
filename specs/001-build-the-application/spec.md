## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users can participate in provably fair, Sybil-resistant sweepstakes where they purchase tickets using WLD tokens, vote for beneficiary charities, and claim prizes through soulbound NFTs. Raffle operators can create and manage sweepstakes with configurable prize distributions and charity beneficiaries.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a verified WorldID and WLD tokens, **When** they view available raffles on the homepage, **Then** they can see all active raffles with their prize pools, schedules, and beneficiaries
2. **Given** a raffle is accepting entries and user hasn't reached ticket limit, **When** they purchase tickets, **Then** they pay WLD tokens, vote for a beneficiary charity, and receive soulbound NFT tickets
3. **Given** a raffle has ended with sufficient participants, **When** the draw occurs, **Then** winners are randomly selected, prizes are distributed, and the most-voted charity receives their share
4. **Given** a user holds winning NFT tickets, **When** they claim their prize during the claim period, **Then** they receive their proportional share of WLD from the prize pool
5. **Given** a raffle operator wants to create a raffle, **When** they deposit 10 WLD and configure raffle parameters, **Then** a new raffle is created with their specified rules
6. **Given** a raffle fails to meet minimum participation, **When** the raffle period ends, **Then** all participants can claim full refunds using their NFT tickets

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a raffle doesn't meet minimum participation requirements?
- How does the system handle prize claims that are never collected?
- What occurs if a beneficiary wallet address becomes invalid?
- How are tie votes for beneficiary charities resolved?
