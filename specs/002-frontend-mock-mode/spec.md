# Feature Specification: Frontend Mock Mode for UI Testing

**Feature Branch**: `002-frontend-mock-mode`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add a feature on the frontend for it to be able to run in mock mode even if user isn't opening it via the world app, so we can easily test UI"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature enables UI testing outside World app environment
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, UI testers
   ‚Üí Actions: Enable mock mode, bypass WorldID checks, simulate user states
   ‚Üí Data: Mock user profiles, simulated wallet addresses
   ‚Üí Constraints: Development-only feature, environment-based activation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements clear from development context
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear developer workflow for UI testing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement supports development and testing needs
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí MockUser, MockWallet, EnvironmentConfig
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All sections completed for developer tooling
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT developers need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific mock libraries or patterns)
- üë• Written for development team and stakeholders

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Developers can enable a mock mode in the frontend application that bypasses WorldID/MiniKit requirements, allowing them to test UI components, user flows, and application features in any browser environment without needing the World app or actual WorldID verification.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer runs the application locally with mock mode enabled, **When** they access the application in any standard browser, **Then** they can interact with all UI components without WorldID restrictions
2. **Given** mock mode is active, **When** a developer clicks "Login", **Then** they are automatically signed in with a mock user profile including wallet address and username
3. **Given** a mock user is logged in, **When** they navigate through raffle creation, ticket purchasing, and prize claiming flows, **Then** all UI interactions work with simulated data and responses
4. **Given** the application is deployed to production, **When** users access it normally, **Then** mock mode is completely disabled and real WorldID verification is required
5. **Given** mock mode is enabled in development, **When** developers want to test different user states, **Then** they can easily switch between different mock user profiles
6. **Given** mock mode is active, **When** payment flows are initiated, **Then** they complete successfully with simulated transactions instead of failing due to missing MiniKit

### Edge Cases
- What happens when mock mode is accidentally enabled in production?
- How does the system handle transitions between mock and real mode?
- What occurs when developers test features requiring specific WorldID states?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide environment-based mock mode activation (development only)
- **FR-002**: System MUST bypass all WorldID verification checks when mock mode is enabled
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide realistic mock user profiles with wallet addresses and metadata
- **FR-004**: System MUST simulate successful MiniKit command responses (walletAuth, pay, verify)
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow developers to switch between different mock user personas
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent mock mode activation in production environments
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual indicators when mock mode is active
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality for real WorldID users when mock mode is disabled
- **FR-009**: System MUST simulate realistic payment flows with mock transaction hashes
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide mock raffle data for UI testing without database dependencies
- **FR-011**: System MUST enable testing of both logged-in and logged-out states
- **FR-012**: System MUST support mock error scenarios for testing error handling

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MockUser**: Simulated user profiles with wallet addresses, usernames, and profile metadata
- **MockWallet**: Fake wallet addresses and balances for testing payment flows
- **EnvironmentConfig**: Configuration system to control mock mode activation
- **MockMiniKit**: Simulated MiniKit SDK responses for development testing
