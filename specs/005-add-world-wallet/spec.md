**Feature Branch**: `005-add-world-wallet`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add world wallet login and account balance display component to be used in diamond hands minigame"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a player of the Diamond Hands minigame, I want to connect my World Wallet and view my current balance so that I can track my holdings while playing the game and understand my available funds for potential game interactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the Diamond Hands minigame page without a connected wallet, **When** they click the wallet connect button, **Then** the World Wallet authentication flow initiates and upon successful connection displays their wallet address
2. **Given** a user has successfully connected their World Wallet, **When** the connection is established, **Then** their current WLD token balance is displayed and automatically updates when changes occur
3. **Given** a connected user is playing the minigame, **When** they perform actions that might affect their balance, **Then** the balance display reflects the current accurate amount from their wallet
4. **Given** a user has an active wallet connection, **When** they return to the minigame page in a new session, **Then** the system attempts to restore their previous connection automatically

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the World Wallet connection fails or times out?
- How does system handle when user denies wallet connection permission?
- What is displayed when wallet balance cannot be retrieved?
- How does the component behave if World Wallet service is unavailable?
- What happens if user disconnects their wallet while playing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a visible button/interface element to initiate World Wallet connection
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate users through World Wallet's standard authentication flow
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the connected wallet address or identifier once authenticated
- **FR-004**: System MUST fetch and display the user's current WLD token balance
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide visual feedback during wallet connection process (loading state)
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle wallet disconnection gracefully with appropriate user messaging
- **FR-007**: Balance display MUST refresh on-demand
- **FR-008**: System MUST display balance in 2 decimals in WLD denomination
- **FR-009**: Component MUST be integrated within the Diamond Hands minigame interface without disrupting gameplay
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle single wallet only, using minikit sdk
- **FR-011**: Connection state MUST persist until explicit disconnect
- **FR-012**: System MUST display appropriate error messages when wallet operations fail

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Wallet Connection**: Represents the authenticated connection between user's World Wallet and the application, including connection status and wallet identifier
- **Account Balance**: The current WLD token balance associated with the connected wallet, including last update timestamp
- **Connection Session**: The active session maintaining the wallet connection state and authentication credentials
