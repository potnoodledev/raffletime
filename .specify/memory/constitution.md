# Anyrand Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All functionality MUST be covered by tests written before implementation. Test-driven development is mandatory for all modifications, new features, and integrations across the entire stack. Smart contracts require unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for multi-contract interactions, end-to-end tests for complete user flows, and fuzz testing for critical functions. Frontend code requires unit tests for components and utilities, integration tests for user interactions, and end-to-end tests for complete workflows. Gas consumption must be tracked and verified in smart contract tests. All tests must pass before any code merge.

**Rationale**: Both smart contracts and frontend code are critical to user safety and experience. Comprehensive testing prevents costly bugs in immutable contracts and ensures reliable user interfaces.

### II. Code Quality Standards
All code MUST adhere to established formatting, linting, and style guidelines across the entire technology stack. Solidity code must follow the official style guide with consistent naming conventions, proper NatSpec documentation, explicit visibility modifiers, and appropriate use of custom errors. TypeScript/JavaScript code must pass strict compilation, use proper typing without `any`, follow established patterns, and include comprehensive JSDoc comments. React components must follow established patterns with proper prop typing, consistent naming, and appropriate use of hooks. All code must use automated formatting (Prettier) and pass linting checks. Code reviews are mandatory with at least one approval required before merge.

**Rationale**: Consistent code quality across frontend and smart contracts reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and ensures team members can effectively collaborate on the entire codebase.

### III. Security-First Architecture
All components MUST implement comprehensive security measures appropriate to their layer. Smart contracts require reentrancy protection, access controls, input validation, and proper error handling with external calls managed carefully and state changes following checks-effects-interactions pattern. Frontend applications must implement secure wallet integration, input sanitization, XSS protection, and secure API communication. Private keys and sensitive data must never be exposed in frontend code. User inputs must be validated both client-side and on-chain. HTTPS must be enforced for all production deployments.

**Rationale**: Security vulnerabilities in any layer can compromise the entire system. Both smart contracts and frontend interfaces are attack vectors that must be secured comprehensively.

### IV. Performance Optimization
All components MUST be optimized for their respective performance requirements. Smart contract functions must be optimized for gas efficiency without compromising security, with gas consumption measured and documented. Frontend applications must implement efficient rendering with proper React optimization techniques (memoization, lazy loading, virtual scrolling), bundle size optimization, and responsive loading states. Network requests must be optimized with appropriate caching, error handling, and retry logic. Performance benchmarks must be established and maintained for both on-chain operations and frontend interactions.

**Rationale**: Poor performance in either smart contracts (high gas costs) or frontend (slow UX) can make the system unusable. Optimization across all layers ensures accessibility and adoption.

### V. User Experience Consistency
All user-facing interfaces and APIs MUST provide consistent, predictable experiences across different networks, devices, and deployment environments. Smart contract interfaces must provide clear error messages and predictable gas estimation. Frontend interfaces must implement consistent design patterns, responsive layouts, and accessible interactions. Error handling must be comprehensive with clear, actionable messages throughout the user journey. Loading states, transaction progress, and confirmation flows must be consistent. Documentation must be comprehensive and up-to-date for both developer APIs and user interfaces.

**Rationale**: Consistent user experience across all touchpoints builds trust and adoption. Complex blockchain interactions should be abstracted into simple, reliable interfaces while maintaining transparency.

## Security Standards

All security-critical operations MUST be implemented following established patterns across the entire stack. Smart contracts must use upgradeable UUPS proxy patterns with proper authorization, OpenZeppelin's security patterns, reentrancy protection, and proper event emission. Frontend applications must implement secure wallet connection patterns, input validation, environment-specific configuration management, and secure API communication. Cryptographic operations must use audited libraries. Multi-signature controls must be used for administrative functions in production. Frontend builds must not expose sensitive configuration or private keys.

## Development Workflow

All changes MUST follow the established development workflow across frontend and smart contract code: feature branches from master, comprehensive testing before merge, code review by team members, automated CI/CD checks passing (including linting, type checking, tests, and builds), and deployment through standardized scripts. Breaking changes must be documented with migration paths provided. Version bumps must follow semantic versioning. Documentation must be updated with all changes. Frontend deployments must use environment-specific configuration and secure build processes.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles across the entire technology stack. Amendments to this constitution require team consensus, documentation of rationale, and updates to related templates and documentation. Complexity that violates these principles must be justified with specific technical requirements and approval from the team lead. Both smart contract and frontend code must adhere to these standards without exception.
