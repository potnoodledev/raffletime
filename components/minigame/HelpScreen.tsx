                  Diamond Hands is a game where you deposit WLD tokens and receive a virtual diamond that changes in value over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every 5 seconds, your diamond's price updates based on market volatility (ranging from -4% to +7%). You must tap the diamond at least once per price update to continue holding it, or you'll automatically sell.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The goal is to hold on as long as possible and sell at the right moment to maximize your profits!

                  World ID is a privacy-preserving identity protocol that ensures you're a real person without revealing your personal information.

                <p>
                  We use World ID to authenticate your wallet and prevent bot abuse while keeping your identity completely private. This ensures fair gameplay for all users.

                  This volatility system is designed with a slight upward bias (more chance of gains than losses), but there's always risk involved. The longer you hold, the more potential for both gains and losses.
